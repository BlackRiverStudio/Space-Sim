Task 1: Product Description

Following the product description below, create a space simulator game

“Create a single player 3D space simulator game. This space simulator can be of 
the style of your choice. You must include space mining and/or combat with at 
least one example of raycasting. There must also be physics based asteroids that 
get managed by a pool manager when spawning and despawning. Your game must also 
use shaders that manipulates textures.”


Task 2: Game must contain the following

To be able to complete this project, the game must contain the following.
 - Two examples of Raycasting. An example of this might be mining, or a 
   rangefinder.
 - A Player controlled model. You should be able to control your ship.
 - Using animations for your spaceship.
 - Pooling. Pooling of objects such as asteroids instead of instantiating and 
   destroying.
 - Import models programmatically.
 - Manipulate texturing through shaders. An example might be making a powerup 
   shine.
 - In world GUI.
 - Using colliders as a trigger for the player. An example is spawning enemies if 
   they enter an area around a space station.
 - Exemption handling. You must have at least 2 examples of try catch, and null 
   checking where necessary.
 - Log errors to a file
 - An example of Level Of Detail (LOD) for meshes.
 - Caustics and refractions shader.

Provide at least 2 screenshots, and explain how you used the following:
 - Breakpoints
   - ship turning decided to break around 11pm tues 15th. currently don't know why and lofi bart simpson isn't helping. two screenshots saved to screenshot folder of computer.
   - it wasn't the cursor lock mode so that's something...
   - next day. it is moving, but everything in the project is running really fucking slowly? huh!?
 - Using the physics debugger to show collision frames


Task 3: Options Menu

 - Resolution
 - Change colour depth buffer(Camera.SetTargetBuffers)
 - Anti - Aliasing
 - Anisotropic Filtering
 - Frame rate limiter
